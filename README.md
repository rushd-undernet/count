I decided to share simple codes that I use on computer that helps me in my daily work.
This is a single line bash script to give **number of files** in a directory. 

It's recommended to make an alias for it in ~/.bashrc
~~~~
alias count-files='bash ~/count.sh' 
~~~~
then
~~~~
source ~/.bashrc
~~~~
## Usage
Go inside any folder you want to count the files in and type
~~~~
count-files
~~~~
